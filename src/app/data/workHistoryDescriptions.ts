export const STRAYOS_ARCHITECT_DESCRIPTION = `
Lead architect and principle implementor for two major distributed services. One a complete overhaul
of core application requiring a migration from AngularJS to Angular, a new Role Based Access Control
system, and a distributed batch processing pipeline.`;

export const STRAYOS_CLI_DESCRIPTION = `
Developed an in house CLI for miscellaneous task such as data migration, data processing, and data
inspection that increased developer productivity.
`

export const STRAYOS_CI_DESCRIPTION = `
Implemented continuous deployment and continuous integration of frontend and backend apps, and
integrated testing suites for both apps.`

export const STRAYOS_REFACTOR_DESCRIPTION = `
Refactored entire front-end code base to reduce technical debt and increase developer velocity. The
refactor reduced build times by an order of magnitude, removed arbitrary dependency limitations
freeing developers to access a vast suite of libraries, and enabled the use of modern web-development
syntax, styling, and conventions. Further redesigned naïve implementations of core features to
eliminate technical depth, increase developer velocity, and ensure consistency and customer
satisfaction.`;

export const STRAYOS_GIS_DESCRIPTION = `
Designed and implemented algorithms for generating high quality digital elevation models from drone
photogrammetry data. Further optimized algorithms though parallelization leading to a 20x speed
increase in data processing on production servers. The integration of these algorithms will potentially
save thousands in software licensing cost. I also created modules for visualizing this data in our webapp.`

export const STRAYOS_IMAGE_DESCRIPTION = `
Designing an automated image processing platform that will serve as both a computer vision test suite
for Strayos’ machine learning team, and a high throughput pipeline for custom data processing.`;

export const STRAYOS_TEACHER_DESCRIPTION = `
Trained development team in modern web development, security, and system administration.
Designed and implemented a system for code review and maintenance of code quality across the code
base. Crafted a set of hiring requirements and test for engineers. Gave technical interviews to potential
new hires. Responsible for explaining the stack: be it frontend, backend, or cloud.`;
